# Inventory Order Prediction
The issue of inventory management (understocking or overstocking of inventory) has long been recognized as a significant challenge, and although various solutions have been proposed by academia, they are not without their limitations. 



A lot of the common ways to deal with inventory problems assume that **demand follows a certain standard distribution**, like Poisson or normal. 
Howver, in practice, **demand does not follow a standard distribution**. So all the models developed automatically fail. 

Hence, the principal objective of the organization is to predict and anticipate market demand. 
The decision has been made to employ Machine Learning models, specifically the **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest Algorithm,** for the purpose of predicting demand. 


The dataset was gathered so that accurate demand forecasting techniques can be used to help the organization increase the efficiency of its inventory. The performance of the machine learning models has been visualized using Python.


The RMSE value is just around 60â€“65 units when applied to the test data. This shows how efficient using sophisticated Machine learning techniques is at predicting demand. It shows that ML models have the best use case when the demand does not follow a standard distribution.
