**Inventory Order Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach**

Inventory management has long been a critical challenge for businesses, balancing the risks of understocking and overstocking. While academia has proposed various solutions, many traditional models are built on the assumption that demand follows standard distributions like Poisson or normal. However, real-world demand patterns often defy these assumptions, rendering such models less effective.

Recognizing this limitation, I have leveraged Machine Learning (ML) models to predict and anticipate market demand. Specifically, we've employed Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms, known for their ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships in data.

Our dataset was meticulously compiled to enable accurate demand forecasting, with the ultimate goal of enhancing inventory efficiency. Using Python, we've visualized the performance of these ML models, yielding impressive results.

The models demonstrated remarkable accuracy, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of just 60-65 units when applied to test data, in comparision to other traditional models giving an error range of +/-600. This performance underscores the efficacy of sophisticated ML techniques in predicting demand, particularly in scenarios where demand doesn't conform to standard distributions.

This approach represents a significant advancement in inventory management, offering a more flexible and accurate method of demand forecasting. By embracing ML, businesses can better navigate the complexities of real-world market dynamics, leading to optimized inventory levels and improved operational efficiency.
